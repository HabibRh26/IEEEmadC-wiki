Title: Medicare 
Description :This is a health care app which was planned to build in such a way that it will remind the patient 
about the time to take the medicine and it will also provide other feature like giving proper suggestions for the pregnant mother.But due to 
some unavoidable circumstances it is now functional for only one feature.But we do have a plan to implement the idea fully in near future.
